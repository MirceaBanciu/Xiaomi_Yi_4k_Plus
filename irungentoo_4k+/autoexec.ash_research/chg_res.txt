This command can be used to change the resolution/framerate to any of the ones 
in the bitrate addresses table. Note that many of the resolutions that are not 
exposed by the interface (like the HDR resolutions) will crash the camera likely 
because there isn't any code in the firmware to actually use them properly.


The command is:
t app test chg_res [index of resolution]


The index of the first resolution in the bitrate addresses table is 0, the 
second one is 1 and so on.

For example on firmware 1.3.11, 4k 60fps is at index 3 so:

t app test chg_res 3

will switch to 4k 60fps on firmware 1.3.11.
