This command can be used to enable hevc. Only problem is that trying to record 
with hevc enabled crashes the camera (firmware 1.3.11). This command may start 
working properly in a future firmware version.


Usage: t app test record <option>
    Test option list:
         show
         dual  [0 | 1] 
         duals [0 | 1] 
         enctype [streamId][encodeType] 
             streamId:   0 -> primary, 1: secondary 
             encodeType: 0 -> H264,    1: H265 


To enable hevc for the primary stream:
t app test record enctype 0 1

Note: primary stream is the .mp4 and the secondary is the .sec file used for 
playback on the camera.

To disable to secondary stream:
t app test record dual 0

To disable secondary stream saving:
t app test record duals 0
